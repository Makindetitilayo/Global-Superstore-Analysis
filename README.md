## Introduction:

The Global Superstore dataset provides detailed transactional records for an international retailer operating across 147 countries. The aim of this project was to analyze sales, profit, shipping costs, and customer behavior to uncover meaningful insights that can support managerial decision-making. 

Using Power BI, the dataset was cleaned, modeled, and visualized to provide actionable answers to seven key business questions. The analysis focuses on identifying profitable markets, detecting underperforming regions and products, and highlighting valuable customers.

## Key Metrics:

- Which countries generated the most profit in 2014?
- Which products drove the highest profits in these countries?
- Which subcategories had the highest shipping costs in the U.S.?
- How profitable was Nigeria in 2014 compared to other African countries?
- What are the least profitable subcategories in Southeast Asia?
- Which U.S. city is least profitable and why?
- Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?

## Skills Demonstrated:

The following Power BI features were incorporated

- Data Importing
- Data Cleaning
- Data Modelling
- DAX Calculations
- Data Visualization
- Dashboard Automation
- Analytical reasoning

### Analysis:

### Countries and Products with the Highest Profit in 2014

The three countries that generated the highest total profit in 2014 were the United States, China with, and India. Within these markets, certain products stood out as top performers. In the United States, Canon imageCLASS, Fellowes Punch, and HP LaserJet were the leading products by profit. In China, Sharp Wireless Fax, Samsung Smartphones, and HP Copiers drove the most profit. India’s profitability was led by Sauder Bookcase, Cisco Phones, and Apple Smartphones. These results suggest that office supplies and technology products are the strongest contributors to profitability across the top markets.

### Subcategories with the Highest Shipping Cost in the United States

In the United States, the three subcategories with the highest average shipping cost were Chairs at $58.43, Phones at $41.02, and Storage at $27.31. The data suggests that shipping contracts and packaging strategies for these subcategories should be reassessed to prevent rising costs from cutting into margins.

### Nigeria’s Profitability Compared to Other African Countries

In 2014, Nigeria recorded a total loss of -$80,800, making it the least profitable market in Africa. When compared with other African countries, Nigeria’s performance lagged significantly. The data indicates that the main factors behind this poor performance were very high discount rates, averaging 0.70, and moderate shipping costs that further eroded margins. This suggests that Nigeria’s losses are driven more by pricing policies than logistics, meaning that discounting strategies in this market need to be restructured to ensure profitability.

### Least Profitable Subcategory in Southeast Asia

Focusing on Southeast Asia, which includes Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, the least profitable subcategory was Tables, with a total loss of approximately $20,000. Among these countries, Indonesia recorded the worst performance in this subcategory, with a loss of $10,700. The consistent losses in this category suggest that Global Superstore should discontinue offering Tables in Indonesia or adjust pricing and shipping strategies in order to minimize further losses.

### Least Profitable U.S. City and Reason for Low Performance

When analyzing profitability by U.S. city while filtering out locations with fewer than 10 orders, Lancaster emerged as the least profitable city, with an average profit of -$157.42 per order. The data reveals that this was largely due to high discounts and significant shipping costs applied to low-margin categories such as Tables and Chairs. The combination of these factors made it nearly impossible for sales in Lancaster to be profitable.

### Highest Profit Subcategory in Australia

In Australia, Appliances recorded the highest average profit, with each order generating an average of $139. This highlights Appliances as a reliable and profitable subcategory for the Australian market, suggesting that greater emphasis should be placed on expanding and promoting this category to increase returns in the region.

### Most Valuable Customers and Their Purchases

The most valuable customers identified in the dataset were Tamara Chand, Raymond Buch, and Hunter Lopez. These customers consistently generated the highest profits for the business. Their purchasing patterns indicate a preference for Accessories, Appliances, and Art. Focusing on maintaining strong relationships with these high-value customers through loyalty programs and personalized offers could further strengthen their contribution to profitability.

## Conclusion and Recommendation:

This analysis reveals clear patterns in Global Superstore’s performance. The United States, China, and India remain the most profitable countries, with office supplies and technology as their strongest categories. However, Nigeria stands out as a market in urgent need of a pricing review, as discounts have eroded profitability. 

In Southeast Asia, the Tables subcategory consistently underperforms, with Indonesia being the weakest market for this product line. Lancaster, the least profitable U.S. city, demonstrates how discounts and high shipping costs can severely damage profitability. 

On the other hand, Australia offers opportunities for growth in Appliances, and top customers such as Tamara Chand, Raymond Buch, and Hunter Lopez provide a chance to strengthen profitability through targeted retention strategies.

Overall, i recommend that the store focus resources on profitable countries and products, reassess Nigeria’s discount policies, discontinue unprofitable subcategories in markets like Indonesia, reduce high shipping costs in the U.S., and implement loyalty strategies to retain the store’s most valuable customers.
